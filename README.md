# Accelerating Scientific Python: JAX, Numba, and Ray in Action

Materials for the [*Accelerating Scientific Python: JAX, Numba, and Ray in Action* tutorial](https://programme.europython.eu/europython-2025/talk/D9JGFG/) at EuroPython 2025.

## Preparation with Google Colab

We will use Google Colab for the tutorial.
Colab provides an out of the box Jupyter notebook environment with all the necessary libraries installed.
And it provides free GPU and TPU access, which is crucial for the tutorial.

You will need to have a (free) Google account to use Colab. Please create one if you don't have one yet.

Please click the *Open in Colab* button below to open the preparation notebook directly in Google Colab:

(raw link: https://colab.research.google.com/github/coobas/europython-25/blob/main/01-preparation.ipynb)

The code is able to run on other environments, e.g. you local machine,
but we cannot guarantee this and we cannot provide support for this.
